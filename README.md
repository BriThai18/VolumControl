# VolumeControl

## Tools
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Pycaw
- Python

## Overview
In this project, I am detecting the finger movement of the index finger and thumb through a video camera to control the volume of the computer. Once a user place their hand in front of the camera, it will detect the movement of the fingers by the various landmarks that are palced on each position of the hand. By detecting these landmarks, we can control the volume of the computer with a Python libary call Pycaw
